# battlebits
-old platformer a tried makeing
-structured very poorly but collision and physics code should come in handy
-second radio button for editor mode
-if any image files removed from recources folder program breaks. Did not add exception handleing for URL not found
-How I handled sprites and image loading was done very poorly, if redone I would have a single Sprite class that takes in its contructor a String which is the path to the folder containing the sprites and then autoload them into an arraylist of images for animation
-couldnt find the version of my code that had a working vcertical platform but shouldnt be hard to figure out
-I barely remember how I made this
